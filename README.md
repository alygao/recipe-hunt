## üíª Technologies
This software uses the following technologies:
* Frontend (Angular/TypeScript)
* Backend (Java/Spring Framework/Spring Security/Maven/Tomcat)
* Database (MySQL)

## üê≥ Deployment - Docker Build
There are 3 Docker files to build the images for the frontend, backend and database respectively:
* `docker/nginx.df`
* `docker/tomcat.df`
* `docker/mysql.df`

A build script is provided in `docker/build.sh` for Linux environments. This script builds the 3 Docker images first and then creates/runs the 3 Docker containers.

If the Docker engine runs inside a virtual machine, you can access the application inside the VM using the URL http://localhost:19090. You can also access the application in the hosting OS using the URL [http://\<vm-hostname\>:19090](http://\<vm-hostname\>:19090). The port number can be customized by modifying environment variables in the `docker/build.sh`

In addition, you can run the application as a service using the provided `docker/docker-compose.yml`: 
```
 $ docker-compose up
```
